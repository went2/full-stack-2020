### Description
This is a repository for submitting exercises in `Full Stack Open 2020` course of University of Helsinki. It's an online course and the site is here:

[Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development](https://fullstackopen.com/en)

I came across this course on the internet and decided to complete exercises e quivalent to 8 and 9 credits. It will not grant me actual credits because I'm not a student of University of Helsinki. As it says on the site:

> Our collaborators, Houston Inc, Terveystalo, Elisa and Smartly.io, have given the promise of a job interview for everyone who completes the course and the project work with maximum credits (9 + 10).

So I want to gain such knowledge and skills sufficient for interview opportunities through the course.

Before taking this course, I have coded some React&Redux for a month. I hope to gain knowledge of backend development and promote stronger skills of React.

Bless me.
